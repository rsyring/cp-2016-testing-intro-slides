Automated Testing Overview & Best Practices
===========================================

The slides for my presentation at [Code PaLOUsa][cp] 2016.

[cp]: http://www.codepalousa.com

Summary
-------

We'll cover testing best practices, ways to make team testing more effective, test centric vs test
driven development, and how to get started testing when there are no tests and the code is messy.
We'll use an example project to see how these ideas flush out in the real world.
